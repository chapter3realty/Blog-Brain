/* /buyers/55-plus-communities/myrtle-trace/ - what it is like to live in Myrtle Trace,
 * a 55+ neighborhood just outside Conway.
 *
 * Version 11b, 2026-10-11: row 93 (to 300 Main Street in Conway, about 10 minutes by car).
 * Version 11, 2026-10-11: the v10 owner's-eye review (OWNER-EYE-v10-myrtle-trace.md): short
 * question headings, the full fence answer above the story (row 54 and its note: perimeter fences
 * only on lots backing onto roads or future development, never golf course or pond lots), people
 * act in every sentence, no "the HOA says", the month section folded into its cards, the homes
 * sentence in two (row 92's middle range: "about 1,500 to 2,100"), "In our experience" as on the
 * other pages, one line under the story (the offer), the bottom offer about rules and costs.
 * The drive to downtown Conway waits for the researcher's verified row (coordinator).
 * Version 10, 2026-10-11: the owner's-eye review of version 9
 * (batches/2026-10-a/OWNER-EYE-myrtle-trace.md) and the coordinator's decisions.
 * Shape: what is close (one map, one link), a normal month, the homes (one-story first, the
 * overview aerial beside the layout sentence, a close aerial of a street of houses, the golf
 * course view before the golf balls, a homes-for-sale offer), Conway in three sentences with
 * its two photos beside them, the money (the $95 fee, no city tax, flood in two sentences),
 * who can live there and the rules (no fence card: the agent finds the fence rule in the
 * story), the comparison led by the good, then the fence example as the last section before
 * the FAQ, under the buyer's question. No dates in captions; the photo year is in the credits.
 *
 * Facts:  batches/2026-10-a/facts/myrtle-trace-facts.md, verified rows only.
 *   Place:   rows 15, 72, 85 to 89; rush hour: stories.json "traffic-timing".
 *   Life:    rows 25, 43 to 46, 78 to 80.
 *   Homes:   row 92 (about 1,000 to 2,900 sq ft; mostly 3 bedrooms, some 2; built mostly 1984 to
 *            1998, "in the 1980s and 1990s"; every home for sale on one level), rows 26, 47 (golf
 *            easement), 48, 59. Row 22 (laid out 1984 to 1994) is cut (owner).
 *   Rules:   rows 1, 6 (no minimum age for the others in the home; OCR copy), 8 and 51, 53
 *            (trucks in the garage; campers and boats at the clubhouse lot with a permit), 54 and
 *            47 (b) (fences: found by the agent in the story), 55, 56, 16, 38.
 *   Money:   rows 81, 30 (exactly $95, the SEO audit), 34, 35, 72, v4 tax plus row 73.
 *   Flood:   rows 60 and 61, 75.
 *   Gates:   row 16 is the HOA's own 2025 gates policy, a primary source, so the gate FAQ stays.
 * Photos: the overview and street aerials (USDA NAIP 2023); Conway riverwalk and Main Street,
 *         each beside its sentence. The cypress photo is cut. The overview is the share image.
 * Story:  an Example (Pat and Max): the agent reads the HOA's design rules for that lot with her,
 *         finds no fence is allowed on a golf course or pond lot and that an approved dog run is
 *         (stories.json "hoa-rental-bans-filtered", "ny-buyer-rules-fit").
